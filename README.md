# wilson64

## Description

Wilson64 is a pure ruby x86-64 assembler. No, really. Worst Idea Evar.

Forked from: https://github.com/seattlerb/wilson/
Refactored by [@ollpu](https://github.com/ollpu) to run on modern Ruby, x86-64 (Linux only).

Why "wilson"? I wanted to name it "metal", but there is an existing
project with that name... So I'm naming it after Wilson Bilkovich, who
is about as metal as you can get (and it is easier to spell than
"bilkovich", even tho that sounds more metal).

Why wilson64? I was on a search for the coolest way of submitting code to a local programming contest.
One idea I had was to somehow write assembly in Ruby, assemble and run it -- maybe by calling an external assembler.
External assemblers turned out hard to call without creating files (which the system prohibits).
There were a couple other projects but none of them had what wilson did: it was self-contained in one file.
I need the whole thing to be in one file to submit it to the contest system. So I started trying to get wilson running.
Turns out it only worked on antiquated Ruby and 32-bit platforms. I ended up rewriting most of it in one week of
intense learning of x86 instruction encoding. And hey, I found a [bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52522544/rbp-not-allowed-as-sib-base) in the original code too. The end result is a monstrosity I'm quite proud of.
You can see my submissions to the contest for [2019](https://cses.fi/214/scores/) and [2020](https://cses.fi/314/scores/).

## Features / Problems

* Generates and runs x86-64 machine code directly. No dependencies.
* Register ruby methods with `defasm`, run inline assembly with `asm`, or make Procs with `asm_proc`.
* Parameters and return values work according to the System V AMD64 calling convention.
* Terrible, yet, awesome.

## Synopsis

```ruby
  class X
    defasm :superfast_meaning_of_life do
      rax.mov 42
    end

    def inline_asm_example
      n = 1000
  
      asm do
        rax.xor rax
        label :count
        rax.inc
        rax.cmp n
        jne :count
      end
    end
  end
  
  p X.new.superfast_meaning_of_life # => 42
  p X.new.inline_asm_example        # => 1000
```
